# Clicky Game

## Overview

This application is a memory game.  The idea is to click on as many images as you can without clicking on the same image twice.  The project is deployed on Heroku and can be found here: https://clicky-game-ucla.herokuapp.com/. 

## Technical Approach
I used react to create this app.
